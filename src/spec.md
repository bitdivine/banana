# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Set the app’s footer (bottom bar) background to white while keeping footer content readable and consistent with the existing banana-themed design.

**Planned changes:**
- Update footer styling so the bottom bar background renders as white across the app.
- Adjust footer text/icon colors as needed to ensure legibility on white in both light and dark mode.
- Keep all other sections (header and main content backgrounds) unchanged.

**User-visible outcome:** The footer displays with a white background throughout the app, with text and icons remaining readable in both light and dark mode.
