No evidence in the diff summary of changes to header or main content UI code, and no backend/model changes are shown. Some unrequested documentation/metadata updates were also made.",

      "description": "Updated documentation/summary content unrelated to the requested footer background change (e.g., HomePage described as using a global cyan background).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest only asked to change the footer (bottom bar) background; updating repository summary files and asserting other page background changes is not requested and could conflict with the non-goal of not changing main page backgrounds.",
